# Issue Planning Skill

Use this skill to transform a raw GitHub issue into a comprehensive implementation plan with
design decisions, task breakdown, and proposal summary — before writing a single line of code.

---

## When to Use

- Starting a new ticket and need a thorough plan before implementation
- Issue description or acceptance criteria are ambiguous and need clarification
- Complex features that span multiple packages (backend + frontend + config)
- Refactoring or infrastructure tasks with unclear scope
- Any ticket where reducing ambiguity upfront will save rework later

---

## Invocation

```
/plan-issue <ISSUE_NUMBER>
```

Example:
```
/plan-issue 456
```

---

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Fetch and Parse the Issue

Run:
```bash
gh issue view <NUMBER> --repo <owner>/<repo>
```

If the repo cannot be auto-detected from the current directory, ask the user before proceeding.

Extract and record:
- **Title**
- **Description / body**
- **Labels** (used for scope detection in Step 3)
- **Assignees**
- **Linked / referenced issues** (look for `#NNN` mentions or "Closes #NNN" in the body)
- **Explicit acceptance criteria** (look for checklist items, "AC:", "Acceptance Criteria:", etc.)
- **Milestone** (if any)

---

### Step 2 — Clarifying Questions (If Needed)

Before exploring any code, assess whether the issue has genuine ambiguity in any of the
following areas. If it does, ask targeted questions — **up to 5 at a time**, then **block**
and wait for answers before proceeding.

| Scenario | Example Question |
|---|---|
| Acceptance criteria are vague or missing | "What specific behavior should a passing test verify? Can you provide an example input and expected output?" |
| Multiple valid implementation approaches exist | "Should we approach this as [Option A] or [Option B]? Specifically: [trade-offs]" |
| Scope boundary is unclear | "Does this ticket include [related concern]? Should [edge case] be handled here or in a follow-up?" |
| Data model or API contract is undefined | "Should the response include [field]? How should validation errors be represented?" |
| Dependencies on other issues are implied but unstated | "Does this depend on #NNN landing first? Is there a hard blocker or just a preference?" |
| Performance or security expectations are unstated | "Are there latency SLAs for this endpoint? Are there security implications around [X]?" |

> **Rule:** Ask questions about acceptance criteria and direction *first*, before code exploration.
> Code exploration informs and validates the plan but must not substitute for explicit requirements.

---

### Step 3 — Auto-Detect Scope

Based on labels, title, and description, classify the work into one or more of the following
domains. Each domain triggers additional targeted questions.

#### Backend / API

Triggered by labels: `backend`, `api`, `server`
Or keywords in title/body: "endpoint", "API", "server", "handler", "route", "service"

Ask:
- "Does this require new database collections/tables or changes to an existing schema?"
- "Are there new complex queries involved that require index definitions?"
- "Do data access rules or permission checks need updating?"
- "Is this a public endpoint or an authenticated one? Which roles can call it?"

#### Frontend / UI

Triggered by labels: `frontend`, `ui`, `client`, `web`
Or keywords: "page", "screen", "dashboard", "form", "component", "route"

Ask:
- "Does this touch authentication-gated routes? Which roles can see it?"
- "Does the data need to update live (subscriptions, polling, websockets), or is fetch-on-load enough?"
- "Does this change navigation structure or add a new top-level view?"

#### Shared / Design System

Triggered by labels: `shared`, `component-library`, `design-system`
Or keywords: "shared component", "design system", "library"

Ask:
- "Does this component need to accept assets (logos, icons) as props rather than importing them directly?"
- "If the project uses visual regression or snapshot testing, will baselines need updating?"
- "Are there consumers of this component in other packages that need updating?"

#### Database / Schema

Triggered by labels: `database`, `schema`, `migration`
Or keywords: "collection", "table", "schema", "migration", "index", "query"

Ask:
- "Is this a breaking schema change for any existing records?"
- "Do existing records need a backfill or migration script?"
- "What is the rollback plan if something goes wrong in production?"

#### Security / Auth / Permissions

Triggered by labels: `security`, `auth`, `permissions`, `roles`
Or keywords: "auth", "permission", "role", "access control", "token", "claims"

Ask:
- "Which roles should have access to this feature?"
- "Are there permission checks that need updating at the API layer?"
- "Are there data-level access controls (e.g. row-level security, database rules, middleware guards) that need updating?"

---

### Step 4 — Code Exploration

Explore the codebase thoroughly. The goal is to understand the *existing* patterns so the
plan stays consistent with them.

1. **Find related implementations**
   - Search for similar features (e.g., other forms, hooks, endpoints, components)
   - Note file structure, naming conventions, and prop patterns
   - Identify the closest 2–3 analogous implementations

2. **Trace the full data flow**
   - From the data source (database, API, external service) through to the UI
   - Note what data is currently fetched, shaped, or transformed at each layer

3. **Identify config and infrastructure gaps**
   - Are there new queries that require index definitions?
   - Do data access rules need new coverage?
   - Do any functions need new documentation or type annotations?

4. **Review existing tests**
   - Find tests for the closest analogous feature
   - Note testing patterns: describe block structure, mock strategies, assertion style
   - Identify any shared test utilities or fixtures

5. **Check permission consistency**
   - When building a data query, confirm which roles should see which data
   - Verify that access control at the API layer is consistent with any data-level rules

---

### Step 5 — Devise Strategy

Produce a clear technical strategy:

- **Chosen approach** with explicit rationale ("We chose X because Y, which avoids Z and
  aligns with the existing pattern in `path/to/file.ts`")
- **Potential risks** and edge cases (data migration, breaking changes, performance, security)
- **Phased breakdown** if the work genuinely spans multiple concerns:

| Signal | Recommended phase boundary |
|---|---|
| Backend + Frontend changes | Phase 1: backend; Phase 2: frontend |
| Feature code + infra (indexes, rules) | Phase 1: infra; Phase 2: feature code |
| Unit tests + integration/E2E tests | Phase 1: unit; Phase 2: integration/E2E |
| Independent sub-features with no dependency | Can be parallelised within a single phase |

> **Rule:** Do not phase trivially small changes. Phase work only when staging genuinely
> reduces risk or makes PRs more reviewable.

---

### Step 6 — Generate Deliverables

Create three markdown documents in `.agents/issue-planner/<ISSUE_NUMBER>/`:

```
.agents/issue-planner/
└── <ISSUE_NUMBER>/
    ├── design-doc.md
    ├── task-doc.md
    └── proposal-doc.md
```

---

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| [Risk] | High / Med / Low | [Mitigation] |

## Effort Estimate

**Overall:** Small (1–2 days) / Medium (3–5 days) / Large (1+ week)

| Phase | Estimate |
|---|---|
| Phase 1 | [X days] |
| Phase 2 | [X days] |

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve this proposal.
2. Follow `task-doc.md` to implement phase by phase.
3. After implementation is merged, delete `.agents/issue-planner/<ISSUE_NUMBER>/`
   and close the issue.
```

---

## When Planning is Complete

1. Present all three documents to the user.
2. Summarize the proposal verbally: highlight key decisions, risks, and effort estimate.
3. Ask: "Does this plan look good? Any changes before we proceed to implementation?"
4. **Stop and wait** — Do not auto-start implementation. Wait for explicit approval.

---

## On Plan Approval

Once the user approves the plan, **before writing any code**:

1. Post the full `proposal-doc.md` content as a comment on the GitHub issue:
   ```bash
   gh issue comment <NUMBER> --body "$(cat .agents/issue-planner/<NUMBER>/proposal-doc.md)"
   ```
2. Confirm the comment was posted successfully (check for the comment URL in the output).
3. Then proceed with implementation following `task-doc.md`.

---

## Cleanup After Implementation

Once the feature is merged:

1. Delete `.agents/issue-planner/<ISSUE_NUMBER>/`
2. Close the issue if it isn't already closed by the merged PR.

---

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Prevention |
|---|---|
| Asking too many questions at once | Cap at 5 per round. Ask the highest-impact questions first. |
| Exploring code before clarifying AC | Ask questions *first*. Code review validates the plan; it does not replace requirements. |
| Vague task steps | Every task step must reference a specific file path. "Update the hook" is not acceptable; "Update `useOrders` in `src/hooks/useOrders.ts`" is. |
| Over-phasing simple features | Phase only when staging reduces risk or improves reviewability. Don't phase trivial changes. |
| Missing security audit | Always ask: "Does this touch auth or role-based access? Do access rules need updating?" |
| Underestimating effort | Implementation is ~50% of total effort. Factor in tests, config, documentation, and PR review cycles. |
