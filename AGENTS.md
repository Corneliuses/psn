# psn

Father–son PlayStation stats tracker for two players (Dad and Braidan): syncs play history and trophy data from PSN into committed JSON snapshots, derives displayable stats, and (in future milestones) renders them as a website with per-player pages and a comparison view.

This repo is a pnpm workspace (`pnpm-workspace.yaml`): the root package (`psn`) is the data-layer lib, `site/` is a separate workspace package depending on it via `workspace:*`.

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: TypeScript 5, strict mode, ESM (`type: module`)
- **Runtime**: Node 22+ (uses `process.loadEnvFile`, `util.parseArgs`)
- **PSN access**: [`psn-api`](https://github.com/achievements-app/psn-api) — import it only via `src/psn/api.ts` (CJS/ESM interop shim); never import `psn-api` functions directly elsewhere
- **Testing**: Vitest, fixture-based — no test may require credentials or network
- **Lint / Format**: ESLint (flat config, typescript-eslint)
- **Build**: tsup (library + CLI), tsx for running the CLI from source

## Commands

| Purpose | Command |
|---|---|
| Install deps | `pnpm install` |
| Lint | `pnpm lint` |
| Typecheck | `pnpm typecheck` |
| Test (all) | `pnpm test` |
| Test (single file) | `pnpm vitest run test/stats.test.ts` |
| Build | `pnpm build` |
| Sync snapshots (needs `.env`) | `pnpm sync` |
| Sync pipeline without credentials | `pnpm sync --dry-run` |

Before committing, lint, typecheck, tests, and build must all pass — for both the root package and `site/` (see below).

### `site/` workspace commands

Run from the repo root via `pnpm --filter site <script>`, or `cd site && pnpm <script>`:

| Purpose | Command |
|---|---|
| Install deps (whole workspace) | `pnpm install` |
| Dev server | `pnpm --filter site dev` |
| Lint | `pnpm --filter site lint` |
| Typecheck | `pnpm --filter site typecheck` |
| Test | `pnpm --filter site test` |
| Build | `pnpm --filter site build` |

`site` has its own ESLint config, TypeScript config, and Vitest suite, run separately from the root package's. Root `pnpm test` only runs `test/` (the data-layer lib); it does not run `site`'s tests.

## Architecture Rules

- **Data flows one way**: PSN API → `src/psn` → snapshot files in `data/` → `src/stats` → UI. `site/` reads `data/*/latest.json` snapshots and `src/stats` (via the `psn` workspace package) only — it must never import `src/psn/` directly.
- **`src/stats` stays pure**: snapshot in, stats out, no I/O. Every new stat function ships with fixture-based tests including empty-snapshot and tie cases.
- **Snapshots are diff-friendly**: stable key order, arrays sorted by stable IDs, 2-space indent, trailing newline. Preserve this — committed snapshot history doubles as the trend-analytics dataset.
- **`schemaVersion` guards `PlayerSnapshot`**: bump it and handle old versions in readers if the shape changes; committed history must stay loadable.

## Security & Secrets

- NPSSO tokens live in `.env` (gitignored) or CI secrets, named per `psn.config.json` (`NPSSO_DAD`, `NPSSO_BRAIDAN`). Never commit, log, or embed tokens in error messages — `PsnAuthError` names the env var, never the value.
- `data/` holds only *real* synced snapshots. Dry-run output is fixture data and must not be committed as if it were real. **Exception:** `data/dad/latest.json` and `data/braidan/latest.json` are currently committed *fixture* snapshots (generated via `sampleSnapshot()`), added in #4 so `site/` has something to import before real sync (#8) lands. Once #8 runs for real, these must be overwritten with genuine synced data, not left in place.

## Working Rules

### Deferred work always gets a ticket

Any work you identify but defer out of the current change — a refactor you're not doing, an edge case you're not handling, a pre-existing failure you're not fixing — must have a GitHub issue created **immediately**, before you move on. If you write "I'll track this separately", "out of scope", or "in a follow-up", the very next action is creating that issue and linking it where you deferred the work (PR body, code comment, or review reply). Never defer work with only a prose note.
